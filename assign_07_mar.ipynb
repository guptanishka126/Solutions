    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how much the data points deviate from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode) and how spread out the values are from one another. \n",
    "1) Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives an idea of the spread of the data over the entire range.\n",
    "2) Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean of the dataset. It quantifies how much the data points differ from the mean and gives an indication of the overall variability.\n",

    "A Venn diagram uses overlapping circles or other shapes to illustrate the logical relationships between two or more sets of items. Often, they serve to graphically organize things, highlighting how the items are similar and different. \n",
    "Venn diagrams, also called Set diagrams or Logic diagrams, are widely used in mathematics, statistics, logic, teaching, linguistics, computer science and business. Many people first encounter them in school as they study math or logic, since Venn diagrams became part of “new math” curricula in the 1960s. These may be simple diagrams involving two or three sets of a few elements, or they may become quite sophisticated, including 3D presentations, as they progress to six or seven sets and beyond. They are used to think through and depict how items relate to each within a particular “universe” or segment. Venn diagrams allow users to visualize data in clear, powerful ways, and therefore are commonly used in presentations and reports. They are closely related to Euler diagrams, which differ by omitting sets if no items exist in them. Venn diagrams show relationships even if a set is empty."

    "Skewness is a statistical measure that quantifies the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of a dataset. It helps us understand the shape of the data distribution and whether it is skewed to the left (negatively skewed) or to the right (positively skewed).\n",
    "In a symmetrical distribution, the data points are evenly distributed around the mean, and the left and right tails of the distribution are approximately equal in length. In such cases, the skewness is close to zero.\n",
    "However, when a dataset is skewed, the mean, median, and mode of the data tend to be different, and the distribution is not balanced. The tail on the side with more extreme values is longer than the other tail. There are two types of skewness: Positive Skewness (Right-skewed) and Negative Skewness (Left-skewed)."

The presence of extreme values on the right side of the distribution pulls the mean in that direction, making it larger than the median.\n",
    "Since the median is the value that separates the lower and upper halves of the dataset, it is less influenced by extreme values compared to the mean. As a result, the median tends to be closer to the center of the dataset and to the left of the mean in a right-skewed distribution."
