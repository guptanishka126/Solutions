    "1) You would typically use a for loop when you know the exact number of iterations you need to perform. It is useful when you have a collection of elements or a known range of values to iterate over. \n",
    "For eg.\n",
    "for i in range(1, 8):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "This will print the numbers from 1 to 7. The for loop iterates over the range of values from 1 to 7, and at each iteration, it prints the current value of 'i'. \n",
    "2) You would typically use a while loop when you need to repeat a block of code until a specific condition becomes 'False'. It is useful when the number of iterations is unknown or depends on certain conditions. \n",
    "For eg.\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "while count <= 10:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "this will print numbers from 1 to 10 this is because the while loop continues util the count variable becomes greater than 10. At each iteratiom, it prints the current value of count and increments it by 1."
